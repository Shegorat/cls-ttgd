## Options

| Parameter | Description |
| ---------- | ------------ |
| `game=<game_id>` | Key ID used for decryption |
| `ver=<version>` | Algorithm version (used together with `key`) |
| `key=<key>` | Hex-encoded decryption key |
| `strict` | Enables strict archive header validation (throws an error instead of skipping invalid files) |
| `t=<thread_count>` | Number of worker threads |
| `r` | Block recompression (currently only `deflate` is supported) |

**Notes:**

- Options can be specified without the `=` separator (e.g., `game42`).
- You can place `zlib.dll` / `zlib64.dll` next to the executable — it will be automatically loaded when recompression is enabled.

## Configuration via `cls.ini`

| Parameter | Description |
| ---------- | ------------ |
| `ThreadCount=<thread_count>` | Number of worker threads (overrides the `t` option) |

**Example:**

```ini

ThreadCount=50%
```
